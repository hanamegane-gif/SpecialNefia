$About This Mod
This mod adds special types of Nefia that apply unique rules to random Nefia.
Clearing a special Nefia grants additional rewards.

Special Nefia may have multiple rules applied at once.

In addition to extra rewards, you may or may not receive Lawless rune shard.
Collecting shards allows you to craft the Lawless rune.
